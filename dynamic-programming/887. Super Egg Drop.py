'''
You are given K eggs, and you have access to a building with N floors from 1 to N.

Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again.

You know that there exists a floor F with 0 <= F <= N such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than F will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor F will not break.

Each move, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor X (with 1 <= X <= N).

Your goal is to know with certainty what the value of F is.

What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what F is, regardless of the initial value of F?

        dp = [[0 for _ in range(N + 1)] for _ in range(K + 1)]
        for i in range(1, K + 1):
            for step in range(1, N + 1):
                dp[i][step] = dp[i - 1][step - 1] + (dp[i][step - 1] + 1)
                if dp[K][step] >= N:
                    return step
        return 0
